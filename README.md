### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer who loves tackling complex problems and delivering innovative solutions in collaborative, fast-paced environments. Passionate about generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), and how they can unlock new possibilities. I've developed several applications using frameworks like Semantic Kernel and Langchain, and I've been working hands-on with the Semantic Kernel .NET SDK since its beta release. Always eager to learn, innovate, and create impactful solutions! ðŸš€
